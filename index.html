    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img3.jpeg" alt="Clue 1" />
      <p><strong>Clue 1:</strong> A CTF challenge hidden in plain sight. Only the sharpest minds realized that this wasn't just a picture—it was the entry point to a digital puzzle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="Clue 2" />
      <p><strong>Clue 2:</strong> An ordinary image... or so it seemed. By tracing how the image file was created, the investigator uncovered traces left by editing tools and compression methods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img1.webp" alt="Clue 3" />
      <p><strong>Clue 3:</strong> The mystery began with a simple text file—empty to the eye, but rich in hidden layers. Its creation told a story not in words, but in metadata.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img4.png" alt="Clue 4" />
      <p><strong>Clue 4:</strong> With all files gathered, the investigation began. Every format, extension, and byte had a role to play. The truth was buried deep—but not unreachable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img5.avif" alt="Clue 5" />
      <p><strong>Clue 5:</strong> Some archives hide more than just files. A .rar may look silent—but layer by layer, secrets unfold for those who dare to extract the truth.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img6.png" alt="Clue 6" />
      <p><strong>Clue 6:</strong> Not everything is as it appears. Some files wear disguises, blending in—waiting to be uncovered by those who dig deeper than the surface.</p>
