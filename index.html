    <h1>🕵️‍♂️ File Type Mystery Gallery</h1>
    <p class="story">
      Five files. Five stories. But something didn’t add up.  
      What you see isn't always what you get—<strong>some secrets are only unlocked through curiosity.</strong>

      <p><strong>Clue 1:</strong> The mystery began with a simple text file—empty to the eye, but rich in hidden layers. Its creation told a story not in words, but in metadata.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="Clue 2" />
      <p><strong>Clue 2:</strong> An ordinary image... or so it seemed. By tracing how the image file was created, the investigator uncovered traces left by editing tools and compression methods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img3.jpeg" alt="Clue 3" />
      <p><strong>Clue 3:</strong> A CTF challenge hidden in plain sight. Only the sharpest minds realized that this wasn't just a picture—it was the entry point to a digital puzzle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img4.gif" alt="Clue 4" />
      <p><strong>Clue 4:</strong> The file’s properties told the real story—size, type, timestamps, even hidden attributes whispered secrets of where it came from... and why.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img6.webp" alt="Clue 5" />
      <p><strong>Clue 5:</strong> With all files gathered, the investigation began. Every format, extension, and byte had a role to play. The truth was buried deep—but not unreachable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="images/img5.jpg" alt="Clue 6" />
      <p><strong>Clue 6:</strong> Not everything is as it appears. Some files wear disguises, blending in—waiting to be uncovered by those who dig deeper than the surface.</p>
